#Basics of the repo

This is a repo that is meant to be collaborative as means to learn Machine Learning. This is a repo that
is full of code from other different languages. I expect that the Python folder will get the most love, but
it will be interesting to see other languages implement the Machine Learning ideas. This will have my own code
and other code.
If you get code from other places please give credit in a comment on top of the file and in the commit messages
